This repository contains pure Python implementation of the gNMI client to interact with the network functions.

=====
Usage
=====
Sample code example:

.. code-block:: python3

  # Modules
  from pygnmi.client import gNMIclient

  # Variables
  host = ('169.254.255.64', '57400')

  # Body
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      with gNMIclient(target=host, username='admin', password='admin', insecure=True) as gc:
           result = gc.get(path=['openconfig-interfaces:interfaces', 'openconfig-acl:acl'])
         
      print(result)

Also integration with Nornir is supported (`refer to examples <examples/nornir>`_).

Dev Log
=======

Release **0.8.14**:

- Number of minor bug fixes and improvements.
- Adding support of `prefix` to `pygnmicli`.
- `Adding error propagation from child thread to main thread <https://github.com/akarneliuk/pygnmi/pull/142>`
- `Changes to u_val <https://github.com/akarneliuk/pygnmi/pull/144>`
- `Adding Master Arbitration support for Set <https://github.com/akarneliuk/pygnmi/pull/146>`
- `Adding bytes_val and leaflist_val with string_val parsing <https://github.com/akarneliuk/pygnmi/pull/151>`

Release **0.8.13**:

- Number of minor bug fixes and improvements.

Release **0.8.12**:

- Fixed operation of `no_qos_marking` flag for `pygnmicli`.

Release **0.8.11**:

- Previous release introduced break for telemetry in `Juniper` due to inconsistency of communicated encoudings in `Capabilities()` and what is really supported in `Subscribe()`.

Release **0.8.10**:

- Automatic detection of supported encoding and using it where applicable (e.g., in `subscribe2` method).
- Possibility to remove `qos` from `Subscribe` for platforms, which doesn't support it (e.g., `Juniper`).

Release **0.8.9**:

- Default value for ``encoding`` everywhere is set to ``None``.
- Method ``capabilities()`` now is called as part of ``connect()`` to collect supported encoding as part of session establishing.
- If ``encoding`` is not specified by user, then it is auto-set based on the list collected via ``capabilites()`` with ``json`` having the first priority follwed by ``json_ietf``.

Release **0.8.8**:

- Added new argument ``-e / --encoding`` to ``pygnmicli`` to specify the encoding, which overrides the default one. Fix for `Issue 58 <https://github.com/akarneliuk/pygnmi/issues/58>`_.
- Fixed minor bug with encoding handling inside ``get()`` and ``subscribe2()`` methods.
- Simplified the code.

Release **0.8.7**:

- Fixed bug, when returned ``json_val`` or ``json_ietf_val`` is not processed correctly if the value is empty string.  Fix for `Issue 58 <https://github.com/akarneliuk/pygnmi/issues/58>`_.

Release **0.8.6**:

- Fixed minor issue with establishing ``insecure`` channel.
- Fixed bug with inabillity to specify ``prefix`` in Subscribe messages for ``subscribe2()`` method.
- **Important**: It is recommended to use method ``subscribe2()`` instead of ``subscribe()`` for building telemetry collectors with ``pygnmi`` as this method is further developed and throroughle tested. The method ``subscribe()`` will be deprecated in future releases.
- Functionality ``qos`` is now properly supported in ``subscribe2()`` method.

Release **0.8.5**:

- Fixed some issues with telemetry representation with ``pygnmicli``.

Release **0.8.4**:

- Change logic of setting default values for some parameters to improve user experience.
- Added ``token`` authentication to ``pygnmicli``.

Release **0.8.3**:

- Changed behaviour of ``subscribe2()`` to RPC to avoid adding the empty ``Extension`` field for no extensions presenting. Fix for `Issue 83 <https://github.com/akarneliuk/pygnmi/issues/83>`_.
- Uppdated documentation with examples in GitHub.
- Added support of History extensions to ``pygnmicli``.

Release **0.8.2**:

- Implemented `History Extension <https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmi-history.md#1-purpose>`_.
- Implemented handling of corner case, where ``--skip-verify`` was failing trying to parse certificate, `which doesn't have CN and SARs <https://github.com/akarneliuk/pygnmi/issues/71>`_.

Release **0.8.1**:

- Removed the need for ``--no-binary=protobuf`` for operation.

Release **0.8.0**:

- **Important**: potentially breaking change. The dependency is moved from ``grpcio-tools`` to ``protobuf``, which as a standalone package has a much newer serion.
- Spec is rebuilt and updated to support gNMI of version ``0.8.0``.

Release **0.7.5**:

- Amended the logic of ``ONCE`` telemetry mode to automatically terminate on receiving ``{"sync_response": True}`` message.

Release **0.7.4**:

- Feature ``skip_verify`` is now stabilised and doesn't require subject alternative names any more.

Release **0.7.3**:

- Amended the logic of ``target`` functionality to be more inline with gNMI Reference.

Release **0.7.2**:

- Minor bug fixing in the ``skip_verify`` logic. **Impotant**: for this feature to work, you need at least one subject alternative name filed (DNS, IP address, email, - any will work). It also doesn't matter which value it has, but at least one item shall present.

Release **0.7.1**:

- Added new argument ``skip_verify`` to ``gNMIclient``, which removes a need to set the ``override`` argument manually. However, the latter one still stays for the backward compatibility.
- Changed default values for arguments ``username`` and ``password`` from ``None`` to ``""``, as with token-based authentication they don't need to be specified.
- Added new argument ``target`` to ``gNMIclient.get()``, ``gNMIclient.set()``, and ``gNMIclient.subscribe2()`` methods. If provided, it adds ``target`` key to ``Path()`` per `GNMI Specification 2.2.2.1 <https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmi-specification.md#2221-path-target>`_.

Release **0.7.0**:

- Added authentication with Token using ``Authorization: Bearer TOKEN``, where ``TOKEN`` is a variable provided as ``gNMIclient(token=TOKEN)`` key (needed for Arista CVP).
- Added functionality to change  ``GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES`` dynamically to ``HIGH`` value (needed for Nokia SR OS).

Release **0.6.9**:

- Adding new documentation for mutual TLS feature.

Release **0.6.8**:

- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.7**:

- Added new ``show_diff`` key to ``gNMIclient`` object (supported values ``print`` and ``get``). When applied, it shows the changes happened to all keys following XPath from all arguments to ``Set()`` RPC at the network devices. It is so fair tailored to OpenConfig YANG modules as it uses some architectural principles of OpenConfig YANG module to re-construct XPath.
- Added an optional timeout to ``connect()`` method.
- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.6**:

- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.5**:

- Implemented ``prefix`` and ``timestamp`` in ``SetResponse`` message.

- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.1**:

- Added support of origin per RFC7951.
- Added timeout to the initial setup useful for long-living connections.
- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.0**:

- Significant improvements in telemetry capabilities of the pygnmi. Now you can use ``subscribe2`` method by simply providing the a corredponding dictionary at input and all modes (STREA, ONCE, POLL) are working correctly.
- Function ``telemetryParser`` is now automatically used inside ``subscribe2``.
- Telemetry is now implemeted using ``threading``.
- Added new unit tests with ``pytest`` and added code coverage with ``coverage.py``.

- Minor improvements and bug fixing.
- Full coverage of unit tests for all operations (Capabilities, Get, Set(Update, Replace, Delete), Subscribe) and all notations of GNMI Path.
