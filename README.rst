This repository contains pure Python implementation of the gNMI client to interact with the network functions.

=====
Usage
=====
Sample code example:

.. code-block:: python3

  # Modules
  from pygnmi.client import gNMIclient

  # Variables
  host = ('169.254.255.64', '57400')

  # Body
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      with gNMIclient(target=host, username='admin', password='admin', insecure=True) as gc:
           result = gc.get(path=['openconfig-interfaces:interfaces', 'openconfig-acl:acl'])
         
      print(result)

Also integration with Nornir is supported (`refer to examples <examples/nornir>`_).

Dev Log
=======

Release **0.8.2**:

- Added corner case handling where ``--skip-verify`` was failing on certificates, `which don't have CN or SANs <https://github.com/akarneliuk/pygnmi/issues/71>`_.

Release **0.8.1**:

- Removed the need for ``--no-binary=protobuf`` for operation.

Release **0.8.0**:

- **Important**: potentially breaking change. The dependency is moved from ``grpcio-tools`` to ``protobuf``, which as a standalone package has a much newer serion.
- Spec is rebuilt and updated to support gNMI of version ``0.8.0``.

Release **0.7.5**:

- Amended the logic of ``ONCE`` telemetry mode to automatically terminate on receiving ``{"sync_response": True}`` message.

Release **0.7.4**:

- Feature ``skip_verify`` is now stabilised and doesn't require subject alternative names any more.

Release **0.7.3**:

- Amended the logic of ``target`` functionality to be more inline with gNMI Reference.

Release **0.7.2**:

- Minor bug fixing in the ``skip_verify`` logic. **Impotant**: for this feature to work, you need at least one subject alternative name filed (DNS, IP address, email, - any will work). It also doesn't matter which value it has, but at least one item shall present.

Release **0.7.1**:

- Added new argument ``skip_verify`` to ``gNMIclient``, which removes a need to set the ``override`` argument manually. However, the latter one still stays for the backward compatibility.
- Changed default values for arguments ``username`` and ``password`` from ``None`` to ``""``, as with token-based authentication they don't need to be specified.
- Added new argument ``target`` to ``gNMIclient.get()``, ``gNMIclient.set()``, and ``gNMIclient.subscribe2()`` methods. If provided, it adds ``target`` key to ``Path()`` per `GNMI Specification 2.2.2.1 <https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmi-specification.md#2221-path-target>`_.

Release **0.7.0**:

- Added authentication with Token using ``Authorization: Bearer TOKEN``, where ``TOKEN`` is a variable provided as ``gNMIclient(token=TOKEN)`` key (needed for Arista CVP).
- Added functionality to change  ``GRPC_SSL_CIPHER_SUITES`` dynamically to ``HIGH`` value (needed for Nokia SR OS).

Release **0.6.9**:

- Adding new documentation for mutual TLS feature.

Release **0.6.8**:

- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.7**:

- Added new ``show_diff`` key to ``gNMIclient`` object (supported values ``print`` and ``get``). When applied, it shows the changes happened to all keys following XPath from all arguments to ``Set()`` RPC at the network devices. It is so fair tailored to OpenConfig YANG modules as it uses some architectural principles of OpenConfig YANG module to re-construct XPath.
- Added an optional timeout to ``connect()`` method.
- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.6**:

- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.5**:

- Implemented ``prefix`` and ``timestamp`` in ``SetResponse`` message.
- Implemented ``alias`` and ``atomic`` in ``Notification`` message.
- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.4**:

- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.3**:

- Implemented ``prefix`` key in the ``Update`` message.
- Added possibility to provide password in STDIN rather than key.
- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.2**:

- Added support of keepalive timer for gRPC session to prevent automatic closure each 2 hours.
- Fixed issue with ``Subscribe`` RPC not sending delete notification in case of a path is removed from the node.
- Added the CLI based tool.
- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.1**:

- Added support of origin per RFC7951.
- Added timeout to the initial setup useful for long-living connections.
- Minor bug-fixing.

Release **0.6.0**:

- Significant improvements in telemetry capabilities of the pygnmi. Now you can use ``subscribe2`` method by simply providing the a corredponding dictionary at input and all modes (STREA, ONCE, POLL) are working correctly.
- Function ``telemetryParser`` is now automatically used inside ``subscribe2``.
- Telemetry is now implemeted using ``threading``.
- Added new unit tests with ``pytest`` and added code coverage with ``coverage.py``.

Release **0.5.3**:

- Minor improvements and bug fixing.
- Full coverage of unit tests for all operations (Capabilities, Get, Set(Update, Replace, Delete), Subscribe) and all notations of GNMI Path.

Release **0.5.2**:

- Minor bug fixing.
- First release with unit tests.

Release **0.5.1**:

- Minor bug fix.
- Brought the gNMI path to the canonical format: ``/origin:element1/element2...``.

- Minor bug fix.

Release **0.4.4**:

- Minor bug fix.

Release **0.4.3**:
